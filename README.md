Linking CO and KOs in RI
5 September 2015; 30 September 2015
This is the plotBRITE branches' README.md file.

plotBRITE is the (apparent) dead end I went down to plot the BRITE hierarchy for each KEGG compound. 
I think that is a dead end, but I want to keep the code here in case I decide to go back.

The ipython notebook: Linking CO and KOs.KL.ipynb is the best place to start.
